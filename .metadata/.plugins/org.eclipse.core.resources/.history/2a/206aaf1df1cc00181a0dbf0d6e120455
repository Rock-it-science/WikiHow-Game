/*
 * The point of this class is to take an input, in this case filelist.txt, which was generated by a windows command, and is a list of filenames of pictures in the pics folder
 * This program will then format those filenames into JSON, so they are readable as javascript.
 * It it never actually called by anything in the program, but if you decide to add more photos, you can easily use this to turn the filelist into JSON
