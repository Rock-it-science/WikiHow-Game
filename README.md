A party game where you get to caption WihiHow pictures

This game is designed to be played much like other party games where you have a host computer (often hooked up to a TV), and a bunch of players on their phones that enter in funny titles for the picture dispalyed on the host's screen.

I'm probably never going to shell out the dough to publically host this, but it is really easy to host this at home with XAMPP, and have your friends connect locally, so long as you don't have too strict a firewall on your router.

Credit to damn.dog for inspiration, and I also copied their folder of images that they ripped from Wikihow, because apparently its harder than it sounds to actually rip a random image from a website and garuntee that it won't be a logo, not to mention most of the photos on there are pretty mundain, and damn.dog seemed to pick the interesting ones.
